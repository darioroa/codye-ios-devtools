# What is Codye?
Codye is a macOS developer tool for exporting your code to different presentation formats.

# What does Codye do?
Codye allows you to enter and edit a snippet of code, controlling lots of aspects about its appearance, including:
- Theme: use over 100 built-in themes, import from Xcode or even create your own hand picked themes
- Background: select a solid, gradient, blurred or image background to frame your code.
- Window options: use solid or blur style, customise the window buttons, padding and margin.

Codye then offers a variety of export formats: 
- PNG & JPG: Best for presentations and social media
- RTF: Best for presentations. This is ideal to create animated transitions in Keynote.

Codye also offers the ability to automate creation of screenshots via Shortcuts. This makes it compatible as a system action, via the command line or even based on other triggers.


# Codye Pros

## 1. Lots of built-in options
Codye has 180 languages and 100 built-in themes as well as 12 fonts, making it easy to integrate into your projects without lots of effort.

Since Codye is a native macOS app it also has the option to use custom fonts.

## 2. Theme customisation
The app allows you to customise any of the built-in themes, to create new code themes.

## 3. Automation

Thanks to its Shortcuts integration, Codye can be automated in a variety of ways. This includes command line tools, system services and Finder Quick actions. 

Here's an example where you can quickly save a snippet from your currently selected text in any other application, by way of a keyboard shortcut:

# Codye Cons
## 1. macOS Only
Codye is a native macOS app, which comes with advantages but also means it's not available in other operating systems. Other alternatives are web-based so they do offer this option.

## 2. Not great for code editing
Codye is best for 1-200 line code snippets, but its editor is quite limited when it comes to larger snippets of code. Performance can be bad, and there is no support for automatic indentation or multiple cursors, which are expected in other code editors.


# How much does Codye cost?
Codye has a one-time purchase of $18.99 (and equivalent in other currencies).
